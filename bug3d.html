    <h1>Game Information</h1>

    <h4>How to Play:</h4>
    <p>
      The game grows bacteria (coloured circles) on the parameter of a sphere. The goal of the player is to eradicate
      them with poison before they reach the threshold where they get to big and are no longer able be killed with
      poison. The player does this by clicking on them. The sphere can be rotated by dragging he mouse on the canvas
      element (If the mouse click isnt working, try clicking and dragging a small amount on the bacteria).
    </p>
    <h4>Winning conditions: </h4>
    <p>
      If there is 1 or less bacteria left when they reach reach the threshold (bactSize = 24 in the code), the player
      wins and are given a score based on when they killed the bacteria. If there is more than 1 bacteria left when the
      bacteria reach the threshold, the player loses.
    </p>
    <h4>Scoring</h4>
    <p>
      The closer the bacteria get to the threshold, the more points you will be awarded when you kill it, rewarding
      patience and risk.
