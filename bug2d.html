    <h1>Game Information</h1>

    <h4>How to Play:</h4>
    <p>
      The game grows bacteria (coloured circles) on the parameter of a dish (white circle). The goal of the player is to
      eradicate them with poison before they reach the threshold where they get to big and are no longer able be killed
      with poison. The player does this by clicking on them.
    </p>
    <h4>Winning conditions: </h4>
    <p>
      If there is 1 or less bacteria left when they reach reach the threshold, the player wins and are given a score
      based on when they killed the bacteria. If there is more than 1 bacteria left when the bacteria reach the
      threshold,
      the player loses.
    </p>
    <h4>Scoring</h4>
    <p>
      The closer the bacteria get to the threshold, the more points you will be awarded when you kill it, rewarding
      patience and risk.
