        <p>
            I am so grateful to have you in my life. We have changed and grown so much together this last year which is
            a
            pivotal time in our lives. I am so so so excited for another year, and another year, and another year hehe.
            My
            excitement for seeing you every time is the same as it was on our first date. I look forward to where our
            future
            takes us and our relationship is something that I have always admired so much. While long distance is tough,
            you
            make it so easy and I cannot be more happier with how we have managed the cards that we have been dealt.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope you crush your economics exam today! You are so amazing and smart and I know you will do great. I
            look
            forward to camping this weekend and spending quality one on one time with you. It will be a great break from
            working long days at RCMP that stretch even longer with class 3 days a week. You push through these long
            days
            and I cannot imagine the drain it would do to me and I admire that you come home tired and welcoming of me
            and
            not
            complaining and frustrated and taking it out on me. I am also excited to take you to Randall King June 27th
            2024
            at the casino and share my love of 90's sound with you.
        </p>

        <p class="far">Love you lots</p>
